### Overview
The repo contains PyTorch Implementation of Moment Exchange (MoEx), described in the paper [On Feature Normalization and Data Augmentation](). For ImageNet and CIFAR experiments, we select [Positional Normalization (PONO)](https://github.com/Boyiliee/PONO) as the feature normalization method. 

#### More information and relevant applications will be updated.
